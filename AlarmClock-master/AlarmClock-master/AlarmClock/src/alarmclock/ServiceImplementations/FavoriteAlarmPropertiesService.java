     * wherever.  The FavoriteAlarmPropertiesService doesn't care where the
     * properties are saved, it only cares that it can load and save them.
     *
     * This becomes very useful for Unit Tests, when we want to test the
     * functionality of this class without having to write and load an actual
     * file using an actual properties loader.  We can mock out the properties
     * loader interface and give a fake properties loader to this class, then
     * we can tightly control the test conditions.
     * See an example of this in FavoriteAlarmPropertiesServiceTest.java
     *
     * Thus for separation of concerns, the PropertiesLoader service is injected
     * by the program before this class is used.  We only need a setter because
     * it is injected once and used internally (it is a write-only property).
